# tmuxControl

Dynamic session-control:

most tmux-managers just initialize a static layout, where this will manage sessions on the fly.
The first intended use case is ssh-connecting to machine-lists found in a config-file, and management of
a) the active list of desired machines for the current session and
b) the session itself.
